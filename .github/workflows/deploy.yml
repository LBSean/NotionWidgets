# Deploys the repo to GitHub Pages on every push to main.
# The live widget URLs will be:
#   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/widgets/<slug>/
#
# Setup (one-time):
#   1. Go to repo Settings → Pages
#   2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
#   That's it — this workflow handles the rest automatically.
